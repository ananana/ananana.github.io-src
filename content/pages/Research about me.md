Title: Academic profile
Category: about

I have a PhD in natural language processing and computational linguistics from the University of Bucharest, with a thesis entitled *Distributional aspects of natural language. Semantic and stylistic dimensions of text*. I am a member of the [Human Language Technologies Research Center](http://nlp.unibuc.ro/people/anauban.html) and a fellow of the Data Science Center of the University of Bucharest.

My **research interests** include: semantic similarity, word embeddings applications, text classification, mental disorder detection, machine learning for NLP, mulitlinguality, authorship attribution and profiling.
