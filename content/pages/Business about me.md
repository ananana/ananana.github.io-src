Title: Business profile
Category: about

I have been working as a freelance software developer for the past 8 years, during
which I have both consulted clients and built software for them to solve their
NLP and machine learning related problems. During this time I have worked
both as part of a team and autonomously, both on novel problems requiring
sophisticated solutions, and on building the applications around them, from
designing the solution, to implementing, deploying and maintaining it, and
training other team members to use it.

As an on-site developer, I worked as a (research) software engineering intern for Google Zurich, and as machine learning intern for Amazon Development Centre Scotland, where I had the opportunity to further learn about what it is to do machine learning to improve a product on which millions of users rely,
working with huge amounts of data.
